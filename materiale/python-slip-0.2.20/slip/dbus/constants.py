"""This module contains some constant values."""

# The maximum value of a 32bit signed integer is the magic value to indicate an
# infinite timeout for dbus. Unlike the C interface which deals with
# milliseconds as integers, the python interface uses seconds as floats for the
# timeout. Therefore we need to use the Python float (C double) value that
# gives 0x7FFFFFFF if multiplied by 1000.0 and cast into an integer.
#
# This calculation should be precise enough to get a value of 0x7FFFFFFF on the
# C side. If not, it will still amount to a very long time (not quite 25 days)
# which should be enough for all intents and purposes.
method_call_no_timeout = 0x7FFFFFFF / 1000.0
