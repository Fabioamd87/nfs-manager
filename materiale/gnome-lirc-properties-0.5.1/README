INFRARED REMOTE CONTROL CONFIGURATION
=====================================

This is a small application like a GNOME control-panel, to allow configuration
of lirc for a user's remote control, and verification that the configuration is
correct.

It is implemented with GTK+, using Python via PyGtk. A working PolicyKit
authentication agent, as provided for instance by PolicyKit-gnome, is
required for administrative tasks.

INSTALLATION NOTES
------------------

You probably want to use these configure options, at least on Ubuntu,
to ensure that all the PolicyKit and D-Bus stuff is installed in the
appropriate place:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --libexecdir=/usr/lib

Get PolicyKit and PolicyKit-gnome from <http://hal.freedesktop.org/releases/>,
if your package manager doesn't list them already.


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Try running gnome-lirc-properties from the command line to see if there is 
any useful output, such as a python backtrace.

Try running the gnome-lirc-properties D-Bus service from the command line, so 
you can see any output from it too:

$ sudo killall gnome_lirc_properties.backend
$ sudo python -m gnome_lirc_properties.backend

You'll need to start using gnome-lirc-properties quickly because that instance 
of the D-Bus service will automatically die after a short time if it is not 
used.
